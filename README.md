RAG-Enhanced Protein Database Using Large Language Models (LLMs)
This project employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs) and SQL-based data retrieval to predict protein attributes from amino acid sequences. The process begins with sourcing protein sequence data from UniProt, followed by preprocessing steps that include tokenization of sequences and encoding of key biological features. A pre-trained LLM is fine-tuned on this dataset, and the RAG framework is applied to generate SQL queries for efficient retrieval of relevant biological data. The model is trained to predict various protein attributes such as function, subcellular localization, binding sites, and disease associations. This approach enhances the interpretability and accuracy of predictions, offering significant potential for applications in drug discovery, personalized medicine, and genetic research.
